--[[
This tutorial is very basic, but is a very powerful function as well. The shell.run command allows us to run a command from within our program as if we were at the terminal.--]]
shell.run("programname")
shell.run("mkdir", "testing")
This would create a testing directory
shell.run("copy", "disk/hello", "world")
This would copy the program hello from the disk directory
and place it as a program called world in your root
directory.
