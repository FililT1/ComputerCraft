This example will check to see if the file exists we will open it in "r" mode to read, it will then read line by line from the file and store that data into an array, we will then print each line of the file with a 1 second sleep between them. We can use the file:write(variable) statement if the file is opened in write mode "w". We can append a file with the "wa" mode.--]]

if fs.exists(filename) == true then

local line = {}
while true do
line[i] = file:read()
if line[i] == nil then break end
print (line[i])
