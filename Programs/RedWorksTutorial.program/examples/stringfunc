--[[
This example uses some basic string functions to modify a string, we will take a long string and shorten it to 10 characters which will all be lowercased.--]]
text = "Hello user and Welcome to the World of ComputerCraft"

blah = string.sub(text, 1, 10)

-- This line says that blah is now equal to 1-10 of text.

blah = string.lower(blah)

-- This line says that blah is now equal to an all lowercase blah.

print (blah)
-- This outputs as  hello user
