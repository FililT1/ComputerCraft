--[[
This example is a great way to check what event is being passed through the pullEvent() statement. It uses a while loop that continually checks the pull event until the q key is pressed.--]]
term.clear() 
term.setCursorPos(1,1)
while true do
event, param1, param2 = os.pullEvent()
print ("Event "..event)
print ("P1 "..param1)
print ("P2 "..param2)
if event == "char" and param1 == "q" then break end
end
