--[[
This tutorial will go over some of the math functions, we'll start with a random number from 1-10, we will then divide that by another random number from 1-20. We will take the result and round upwards to a whole number. Meaning that if our answer is 3.1 it will still round up to 4. You'll notice the math.ciel function which does our rounding, we could also use math.floor which would round down instead.--]]
num1 = math.random(1,10)
num2 = math.random(1,20)
print ("Number 1 is "..num1)
print ("Number 2 is "..num2)
result = num1 / num2
print ("UnRounded Result is "..result)
result = math.ceil(result)
print ("Rounded Result is "..result)
