This tutorial will go over some of the basic floppy functions. We will check to see if a floppy is inserted using the pullEvent() loop, we will then make sure the floppy doesn't have a label, and if it's label is empty we will label it Blank and exit the program. We can learn more about the disk functions by typing help disk at the terminal.--]]
while true do
event, param1 = os.pullEvent()
if event == "disk" then
	if disk.getLabel(param1) == nil then
	disk.setLabel(param1, "Blank")
	print ("Disk labeled to Blank")
	print ("Disk is in the "..param1.." side")
	break
	else
	print ("Disk already has a label.")
	print ("Disk is in the "..param1.." side")
	break
	end
end
end
